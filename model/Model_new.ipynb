Industry Overview and Trends: The agricultural industry in Sri Lanka is moving towards more sustainable and eco-friendly farming practices to meet growing local and international demand. Problem Statement: The rising cost of conventional farming inputs and environmental degradation calls for more sustainable farming techniques. Proposed Agricultural Solution: Green Grow Farms provides innovative farming techniques, including organic fertilizers, controlled indoor farming systems, and practices to preserve biodiversity. Market Analysis: The demand for organic products is on the rise, driven by health-conscious consumers both locally and internationally. Sustainable Farming Practices: The farm will use environmentally friendly methods, focusing on organic inputs, water conservation, and crop rotation to ensure long-term soil fertility. Supply Chain and Distribution: Partnerships with local retailers, organic food suppliers, and export markets are planned to distribute produce efficiently. Financial Projections: Estimated revenue in the first year is $50,000, with anticipated growth of 20% per year. Implementation Timeline: The first harvest is expected within 6 months, with full-scale production to follow within a year. Conclusion: Green Grow Farms aims to contribute to the sustainable agricultural landscape in Sri Lanka, offering eco-friendly solutions to modern farming challenges\"\n",
